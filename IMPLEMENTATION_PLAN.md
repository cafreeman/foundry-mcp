# Foundry CLI Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Building a Rust CLI tool that manages project structure in `~/.foundry/` to help LLMs maintain context about software projects through structured specifications.

**Core Principle**: Foundry is a **pure file management tool** - LLMs provide ALL content as arguments, we just write it to the correct structured locations with rich parameter guidance.

## MVP Scope: CLI Commands Only

Focus on the 7 core CLI commands identified in the PRD, saving the MCP server implementation for later.

## Current Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED

- **Project Structure**: Complete module hierarchy (cli/, core/, types/, utils/)
- **Core Types**: All data structures defined with proper validation
- **File System**: Atomic file operations and foundry directory management
- **CLI Framework**: Full command structure with clap integration
- **Validation**: Required fields properly enforced (LLM content must be provided)

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Commands Implementation - MOSTLY COMPLETED

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY RESOLVED**: The fundamental LLM workflow gap has been closed!

**Completed Commands:**

- ✅ `foundry create_project` - Project creation with LLM content (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry list_projects` - Project discovery (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry load_project` - Load project context for LLM sessions (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry create_spec` - Timestamped spec creation (DONE)

**Critical Workflow Now Complete**: create → list → load → create spec → load project → work

**Remaining Commands:**

- `foundry analyze_project` - Codebase analysis
- ✅ `foundry load_spec` - Spec content retrieval (COMPLETED)
- `foundry get_foundry_help` - Workflow guidance
- `foundry validate_content` - Content validation

**✅ Spec Management Core Logic COMPLETED**: All spec validation, directory management, listing/filtering, and content operations are now fully implemented and tested.

**✅ Gap Resolved**: `load_project` has been implemented and tested! LLMs can now create projects and load context back to continue work. The fundamental workflow is complete: create → list → **LOAD** → work.

**Current Priority**: Continue with remaining commands to complete full spec management workflow.

**Key Architectural Decision**: All content fields that LLMs must provide are **required** fields, ensuring the "pure file management" principle is maintained.
