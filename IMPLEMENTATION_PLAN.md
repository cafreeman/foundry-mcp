# Foundry CLI Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Building a Rust CLI tool that manages project structure in `~/.foundry/` to help LLMs maintain context about software projects through structured specifications.

**Core Principle**: Foundry is a **pure file management tool** - LLMs provide ALL content as arguments, we just write it to the correct structured locations with rich parameter guidance.

## MVP Scope: CLI Commands Only

Focus on the 7 core CLI commands identified in the PRD, saving the MCP server implementation for later.

## Current Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED

- **Project Structure**: Complete module hierarchy (cli/, core/, types/, utils/)
- **Core Types**: All data structures defined with proper validation
- **File System**: Atomic file operations and foundry directory management
- **CLI Framework**: Full command structure with clap integration
- **Validation**: Required fields properly enforced (LLM content must be provided)

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Commands Implementation - COMPLETED

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY RESOLVED**: The fundamental LLM workflow gap has been closed!

**Completed Commands:**

- ✅ `foundry create_project` - Project creation with LLM content (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry list_projects` - Project discovery (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry load_project` - Load project context for LLM sessions (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry create_spec` - Timestamped spec creation (DONE)
- ✅ `foundry load_spec` - Spec content retrieval (COMPLETED)
- ✅ `foundry analyze_project` - Pure file management for LLM-analyzed projects (COMPLETED)
- ✅ `foundry validate_content` - Content validation with structured feedback (COMPLETED)

**✅ Core Workflow Complete**: create → list → load → create spec → validate → get help → work

**✅ All CLI Commands Complete (8/8):**

- ✅ `foundry get_foundry_help` - Workflow guidance with comprehensive help topics (COMPLETED)

**✅ Spec Management Core Logic COMPLETED**: All spec validation, directory management, listing/filtering, and content operations are now fully implemented and tested.

**✅ Gap Resolved**: `load_project` has been implemented and tested! LLMs can now create projects and load context back to continue work. The fundamental workflow is complete: create → list → **LOAD** → work.

**✅ CLI MVP COMPLETE**: All 8 CLI commands implemented with comprehensive testing. Ready for Phase 2: MCP Server implementation.

**Key Architectural Decision**: All content fields that LLMs must provide are **required** fields, ensuring the "pure file management" principle is maintained.

### ✅ Phase 4: Analysis and Validation Tools - COMPLETED

**Estimated Time**: Week 1 → **COMPLETED**

**CRITICAL DESIGN CORRECTION**: During implementation, we discovered that providing scanning utilities violates Foundry's core principle of being content-agnostic. LLMs already have superior analysis tools (codebase_search, grep_search, read_file), so we pivoted to pure file management following the "LLMs provide content, Foundry manages files" principle.

- [x] **Enhanced input validation** - Project name validation, content size limits
- [x] **LLM-provided content acceptance** - Requires vision, tech_stack, summary parameters
- [x] **Project structure creation** - Write LLM content to structured format
- [x] **Enhanced error handling** - Detailed error messages with actionable guidance
- [x] **CLI parameter guidance** - Rich descriptions guide LLM behavior
- [x] **Workflow hints** - Directs LLMs to use their superior analysis tools

#### ✅ `validate_content` Command - COMPLETED

- [x] **Length validation** - Minimum/maximum size checking with clear error messages
- [x] **Content quality suggestions** - Improvement recommendations for each type
- [x] **Enhanced error reporting** - Structured validation results with counts
- [x] **Content-type specific guidance** - Tailored hints for each content type
- [x] **Input validation** - Size limits, binary detection, empty content handling
- [x] **Enhanced user experience** - Dynamic next steps based on validation results

#### ✅ Validation Core Logic - COMPLETED

- [x] **Comprehensive validation in `core/validation.rs`** - All content types supported
- [x] **Validation rule engine** - Flexible rules with structured feedback
- [x] **Error and suggestion system** - Clear separation of errors vs improvements
- [x] **Content type parsing** - Robust parsing with enhanced error messages

#### ✅ Architecture Cleanup - COMPLETED

- [x] **Removed obsolete `analysis.rs`** - 363 lines of dead code eliminated
- [x] **Clean module structure** - No redundant scanning functionality
- [x] **Aligned with core principles** - Pure file management, no content generation

### ✅ Phase 5: Help and Documentation System - COMPLETED

**Estimated Time**: 3 days → **COMPLETED**

#### ✅ `get_foundry_help` Command - COMPLETED

- [x] **Create help topic system** - Implemented 5 topics: overview, workflows, content-examples, project-structure, parameter-guidance
- [x] **Implement workflow guidance content** - Comprehensive LLM development workflows with step-by-step instructions
