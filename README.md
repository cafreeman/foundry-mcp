# Foundry MCP

**Deterministic project context management for AI coding assistants**

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to maintain persistent project context, specifications, and task lists across development sessions. Stores all context in `~/.foundry/` to keep your codebase clean.

## Installation

### Install from crates.io

```bash
cargo install foundry-mcp
```

## Setup with AI Assistants

After installation, configure Foundry with your AI development environment:

```bash
# For Cursor
foundry install cursor

# For Claude Code
foundry install claude-code

# Verify installation
foundry status
```

That's it! Foundry MCP tools are now available in your AI assistant.

**Installation includes helpful templates:**

- **Cursor**: Gets `.cursor/rules/foundry.mdc` with edit_commands guidance and workflow examples
- **Claude Code**: Gets `~/.claude/agents/foundry-mcp-agent.md` with edit_commands usage and intelligent defaults

## Why Foundry?

- üéØ **Persistent Context**: Never lose project context between AI sessions
- üóÇÔ∏è **Clean Separation**: Project specs stored outside your codebase in `~/.foundry/`
- üìã **Structured Planning**: Organized specifications with task breakdowns
- üîÑ **Resume Work**: Pick up complex development exactly where you left off
- üõ†Ô∏è **Deterministic**: Reliable file operations instead of error-prone AI prompting

## Problem Statement

Current AI coding assistant workflows suffer from critical issues:

- **Inconsistent file management**: Prompt-driven systems create files in unpredictable locations
- **Project directory pollution**: Context management files clutter the actual codebase
- **Context loss**: No reliable way to pause/resume complex development tasks across sessions
- **Error-prone prompting**: Relying on natural language instructions for file system operations leads to inconsistent behavior

## Solution Overview

Foundry MCP provides a set of MCP tools that enable deterministic project and specification management through a centralized file system outside of project directories.

### Core Value Propositions

1. **Deterministic operations**: MCP tools eliminate prompt-driven file system errors
2. **Clean project separation**: Context files stored outside project directories
3. **Persistent context**: Natural pause/resume functionality through structured file storage
4. **Hierarchical organization**: Project-level context with individual specs and task lists
5. **Simplified installation**: One-command setup with PATH-based reliability and automatic configuration

## MCP Tools

Foundry provides 9 MCP tools that enable comprehensive project management for AI assistants:

### Project Management

- **`create_project`**: Create new project with vision, tech stack, and summary
- **`analyze_project`**: Create project structure by analyzing existing codebases
- **`load_project`**: Load complete project context for LLM sessions
- **`list_projects`**: List all available projects with metadata

### Specification Management

- **`create_spec`**: Create timestamped specification with task breakdown
- **`load_spec`**: Load specification content with project context
- **`update_spec`**: Edit spec files with deterministic edit commands (operation: `edit_commands`)
- **`delete_spec`**: Delete existing specification and all its files

### Content & Workflow

- **`validate_content`**: Validate content against schema requirements
- **`get_foundry_help`**: Get comprehensive workflow guidance and examples

## How It Works

Foundry stores structured project context in `~/.foundry/`:

```
~/.foundry/my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vision.md          # Product vision and goals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tech-stack.md      # Technology decisions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.md         # Quick context summary
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250826_143052_user_auth/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md        # Feature requirements
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-list.md   # Implementation checklist
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.md       # Design decisions
```

**Benefits**: Clean codebase separation ‚Ä¢ Persistent across git operations ‚Ä¢ Chronological feature tracking

## AI Assistant Benefits

When you work with AI assistants like Claude or Cursor, Foundry provides:

### üîÑ **Session Continuity**

```
Day 1: "Build a task management app"
‚Üí AI creates project with vision, tech stack, feature specs

Day 5: "Let's work on authentication"
‚Üí AI loads complete context, knows exactly what you're building
```

### üìã **Structured Development**

- **Project-level context**: Vision, tech decisions, and architecture choices persist
- **Feature specifications**: Detailed requirements with implementation task lists
- **Progress tracking**: Task lists update as AI completes work

### üß† **Enhanced AI Performance**

- **No repeated explanations**: AI loads full project context in seconds
- **Consistent decisions**: Technology choices and architecture preserved
- **Better code quality**: Specifications guide implementation details
- **Reduced hallucination**: Structured context prevents AI from making assumptions

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Deterministic Edit Commands**

- **Precise updates**: Set task status, upsert tasks, append to sections reliably
- **Idempotent**: Safe to re-run the same commands without duplication
- **Simple selectors**: Use exact task text or section headers (case-insensitive)
- **Actionable errors**: Candidate selector suggestions on ambiguity

### ü§ù **Collaborative User Experience**

- **Option-based guidance**: All tools provide "You can..." suggestions instead of directive commands
- **Content creation acknowledgment**: Tools explicitly recognize AI assistant's role in content generation
- **Workflow efficiency**: Smart guidance for optimal tool selection and usage patterns
- **User decision-making control**: Preserves user agency while providing helpful guidance
