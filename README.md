# Foundry MCP

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides deterministic tools for AI coding assistants to manage project context, specifications, and task lists. Foundry solves the persistent problem of context management in long-term software development by providing centralized, structured storage outside of project directories.

## Core Value Proposition

Foundry MCP enables AI assistants like Claude to:
- **Maintain persistent context** across development sessions
- **Manage project specifications** with structured task lists
- **Store context outside codebases** to avoid directory pollution
- **Resume complex work** through deterministic file operations

**Primary Use**: MCP server integration with AI development environments  
**Bonus Feature**: CLI interface available for testing and debugging MCP tools

## Problem Statement

Current AI coding assistant workflows suffer from several critical issues:

- **Inconsistent file management**: Prompt-driven systems create files in unpredictable locations
- **Project directory pollution**: Context management files clutter the actual codebase
- **Context loss**: No reliable way to pause/resume complex development tasks across sessions
- **Error-prone prompting**: Relying on natural language instructions for file system operations leads to inconsistent behavior

## Solution Overview

Foundry MCP provides a set of MCP tools that enable deterministic project and specification management through a centralized file system outside of project directories.

### Core Value Propositions

1. **Deterministic operations**: MCP tools eliminate prompt-driven file system errors
2. **Clean project separation**: Context files stored outside project directories
3. **Persistent context**: Natural pause/resume functionality through structured file storage
4. **Hierarchical organization**: Project-level context with individual specs and task lists

## MCP Tools

Foundry provides 8 MCP tools that enable comprehensive project management for AI assistants:

### Project Management
- **`create_project`**: Create new project with vision, tech stack, and summary
- **`analyze_project`**: Create project structure by analyzing existing codebases  
- **`load_project`**: Load complete project context for LLM sessions
- **`list_projects`**: List all available projects with metadata

### Specification Management  
- **`create_spec`**: Create timestamped specification with task breakdown
- **`load_spec`**: Load specification content with project context

### Content & Workflow
- **`validate_content`**: Validate content against schema requirements
- **`get_foundry_help`**: Get comprehensive workflow guidance and examples

## File System Structure

Foundry stores all project data in `~/.foundry/` to keep your actual codebase clean:

```
~/.foundry/
â”œâ”€â”€ project-name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vision.md          # High-level product vision and goals
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tech-stack.md      # Technology choices and architecture  
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ summary.md         # Concise project summary for quick context
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ specs/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ 20250826_143052_user_auth/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spec.md        # Feature specification and requirements
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task-list.md   # Implementation checklist (updated by agents)
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notes.md       # Design decisions and additional context
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 20250826_145230_payment_system/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ spec.md
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ task-list.md
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ notes.md
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Clean separation**: Project context never pollutes your actual codebase
- **Persistent context**: Survive git operations, branch switches, and deployments  
- **Hierarchical organization**: Project-level vision with feature-specific specs
- **Timestamped specs**: Chronological tracking of feature development

## AI Assistant Workflow

Foundry MCP enables powerful workflows for AI assistants like Claude:

### Typical LLM Development Session

1. **Project Setup**: AI assistant creates project context
   ```
   User: "Help me build a task management web app"
   AI: Uses create_project to establish vision, tech stack, and summary
   ```

2. **Feature Planning**: Break down work into specifications
   ```  
   AI: Uses create_spec to create "user_authentication" spec with task breakdown
   AI: Uses create_spec to create "task_crud_operations" spec with implementation plan
   ```

3. **Context Loading**: Resume work with full context
   ```
   User: "Let's work on authentication"  
   AI: Uses load_spec to retrieve authentication specification + project context
   AI: Now has complete context to implement features correctly
   ```

4. **Iterative Development**: Maintain context across sessions
   ```
   AI: Updates task-list.md as work progresses
   AI: Uses validate_content to ensure specifications meet quality standards
   AI: Uses get_foundry_help for workflow guidance when needed
   ```

### Key LLM Benefits

- **No context loss**: Project details persist between conversations
- **Structured planning**: Specs and task lists guide implementation
- **Clean codebases**: Context stored outside project directories  
- **Resumable work**: Load complete context instantly in any session

## MCP Server Setup

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd foundry-mcp
cargo build --release

# Start the MCP server  
./target/release/foundry-mcp serve
```

### Integration with AI Clients

Configure your AI development environment to use Foundry MCP:

**Claude Desktop**: Add to your MCP settings
**VS Code**: Configure MCP client extension  
**Cursor**: Set up as MCP server

*Note: Specific integration guides coming soon*

## Development and Testing

For developers and advanced users, Foundry includes a CLI interface to test and debug the MCP tools:

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start MCP server for AI integration (primary use case)
foundry serve

# Start with verbose logging for debugging  
foundry serve --verbose
```

### CLI Tool Testing

You can invoke the MCP tools directly from command line for testing:

```bash
# Test project creation
foundry mcp create-project my-test-project --vision "..." --tech-stack "..." --summary "..."

# List all projects
foundry mcp list-projects  

# Load project context
foundry mcp load-project my-test-project

# Create a specification  
foundry mcp create-spec my-test-project auth_system --spec "..." --notes "..." --tasks "..."

# Get help on workflow
foundry mcp get-foundry-help workflows

# Validate content before creating projects/specs
foundry mcp validate-content --content-type vision --content "..."
```

*Note: CLI usage is primarily for development and testing. The main value is in MCP server integration with AI assistants.*

## Development

## Architecture

Foundry MCP is built with a modular Rust architecture:

### Core Modules
- **`mcp/`**: MCP server implementation with tool definitions and handlers
- **`cli/`**: Command-line interface for development and testing  
- **`core/`**: Business logic for projects, specifications, and validation
- **`types/`**: Data structures and response formats
- **`utils/`**: Timestamp handling, paths, and formatting utilities

### Key Design Principles
- **MCP-first architecture**: All functionality exposed as MCP tools
- **CLI reuses MCP tools**: Command-line interface calls the same tool implementations
- **Pure file management**: No content generation - LLMs provide all content
- **Structured storage**: Deterministic file organization in ~/.foundry/
